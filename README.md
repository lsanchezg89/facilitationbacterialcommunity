# Assessing the feasibility of a non-genetic facilitation mechanism in 2D artificial bacterial communities via mathematical modeling: Supplementary material

This repository contains supplementary material of the paper.

## Supplementary Methods

Python code for solving the reaction-difussion model can be found [here](Code/ScriptASR.py).

## Suplementary Results

Simulations of confronted-colonies and artificial communities can be found [here](Simulations).

### Original Model

Simulations of confronted-colonies for [A-A](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AA_OriginalModel.mp4), [A-R](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AR_OriginalModel.mp4) and [A-S](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AS_OriginalModel.mp4). Antagonists are in red, sensitive bacteria in green and resistant bacteria in blue.

### First Model Amendment: Antagonists don't produce metabolite $m$

- Simulations of confronted-colonies for [A-R](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AR_NomforA.mp4) and [A-S](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AS_NomforA.mp4). Antagonists are in red, sensitive bacteria in green and resistant bacteria in blue.

- Simulations of artificial communities for [A-S](Simulations/Artificial-Communities/ArtificialCommunities_AS_NomforA.mp4) and [A-S-R](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AS_NomforA.mp4). Antagonists are in red, sensitive bacteria in green, resistant bacteria are not shown. Unlike the figures shown in the manuscript, concentrations shown here were not binarized.

### Second Model Amendment: Considering bacterial aggregates

- Simulations of confronted-colonies for [A-A](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AA_BacterialAggregates.mp4), [A-R](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AR_BacterialAggregates.mp4) and [A-S](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AS_BacterialAggregates.mp4). Antagonists are in red, sensitive bacteria in green and resistant bacteria in blue.

- Simulations of artificial communities for [A-S](Simulations/Artificial-Communities/ArtificialCommunities_AS_BacterialAggregates.mp4) and [A-S-R](Simulations/Confronted-Colonies/ConfrontedColonies_AS_BacterialAggregates.mp4). Antagonists are in red, sensitive bacteria in green, resistant bacteria are not shown. Unlike the figures shown in the manuscript, concentrations shown here were not binarized.
